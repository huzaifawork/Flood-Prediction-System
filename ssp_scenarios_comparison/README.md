# SSP Scenarios Comparison
## SSP 245 vs SSP 585 Climate Projections

### Overview
This comparison shows the differences between SSP 245 (Moderate Emissions) and SSP 585 (High Emissions) scenarios for the Swat River Basin flood prediction system.

### Key Differences

**SSP 245 (Moderate Emissions):**
- Temperature increase: +1.3째C to +2.5째C by 2100
- Precipitation change: -10% to +15%
- Moderate climate action and sustainable development
- Lower flood risk and fewer extreme events

**SSP 585 (High Emissions):**
- Temperature increase: +2.5째C to +3.7째C by 2100  
- Precipitation change: -20% to +23%
- Limited climate action, fossil-fueled development
- Higher flood risk and more extreme events
